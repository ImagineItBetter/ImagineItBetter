# Independent Majority Resolution
## Independent, Best-of-X, Binary Resolution

Version 1.1

A resolution mechanic that aims to build tension while leaving the outcome to a majority rather than a single roll.

Independent Majority Resolution is a resolution mechanic used to simulate complicated tasks and introduce degrees of success and failure into a roll, regardless of the binary success/failure outcome of each individual roll. It works well for tasks that include multiple steps, like disarming a trap, resolving a chase scene or creating a suitable shelter for the night.

To create an Independent Majority Resolution check, decide the resolution maximum and the success threshold. The resolution maximum is how many dice can be rolled – the “five” in three out of five. The success threshold is how many successes are required to proceed – the “three” in three out of five. Common resolution maximums will be three, five, or seven, but any odd number works as long as you're willing to keep rolling [Designer Note 1](#Designer Note 1).

##### Designer Note 1
Checks like “one out of three”, “three out of five” or “five out of seven” seem most common, but higher numbers will continue to undercut the speed.  

Another way to use this check is tracking the successes and failures across rounds (rather than resolving all at once), and allowing players to apply rolls to the check at other times (not necessarily on their own turn and not necessarily with their own action). This can be used in cases where you want to track how well something is going, but not cost a player their action or make it the main focus.
